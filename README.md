# GenC
A scaffolder for initializing cmake projects really fast

## Usage

NOTE! This setup requires you to already have installed cmake on your device.
Download the executable from the "Releases" section and run the command:

```genc PROJECT_NAME```

A project will be initialized with a new folder with the name passed to the command,
a src folder within it with a main.cpp file, then a CMakeList.txt and a build folder (empty).
